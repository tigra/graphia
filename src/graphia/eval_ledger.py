"""Pure, Textual-free data layer for the eval-ledger viewer (spec 012, Slice 1).

Parses the repo-committed quality ledger (``evals/blunder-ledger.yaml`` — one
``---``-separated YAML document per run, written by spec 011's
``blunder_eval``) and flattens each *heterogeneous* record into one stable
table model. This is the increment that finally takes on the YAML-parser
dependency 011 deliberately deferred (``evals/README.md``): the ledger is read
with ``yaml.safe_load_all`` — multi-document, data-only, **no object
construction**, so it is read-only by construction.

**No Textual import lives here on purpose.** All of the parsing, the column
model, the cell formatting, and the per-row search blobs are unit-testable
without driving a TUI; the thin Textual viewer (a later task) consumes the
:class:`TableModel` this module emits and adds the Rich/`DataTable` presentation
on top. The pure layer emits **plain strings** — Rich stays a UI concern.

**Heterogeneity is absorbed here (the headline risk, tech-spec 012 §3).** The
committed ledger already mixes shapes: early *pre-provenance* records carry no
``code`` block, no ``settings`` block, no ``ci_low``/``ci_high``, and put the
game count under ``run.games``; later records carry the full ``code`` /
``settings`` / CI blocks and ``settings.games``. Every field read goes through
:func:`_dig`, a defensive dotted-get with a default — a ``KeyError`` from a
missing nesting level (or a missing nested ``metrics.self_vote.initiation``)
must never reach the UI.

    **no Rich/Textual concern lives here**, mirroring the table model's
    plain-string contract.

    Defensive throughout: every field is read via :func:`_dig`, so a

    shows as :data:`_ABSENT` (``—``) and a whole absent sub-block collapses to a
    single ``—`` line. A ``KeyError`` never escapes.

    What each section shows:

    - **run** — date, ``duration_seconds``, ``metrics_version``, and the
      ``run.games`` fallback count when present.
    - **code** — ``commit``, ``branch``, and the working-copy state spelled out
      as ``dirty`` / ``clean`` (the table only flags it with ``⚠``).
    - **provider** — ``name`` and the resolved model ids, then the
      shape-specific extras: ollama ``models`` digests + ``server_version``, or
      the bedrock ``note``.
    - **settings** — the effective resolved values incl. ``games``, plus
      ``metrics_version`` mirrored here for a like-for-like repeat.
    - **quality** — the run-quality counts.
    - **outcomes** — the win-rate by side (013 §2.1): ``games``, then
      ``law_abiding``/``mafia`` each with ``wins`` + **full-precision** ``rate`` +
      a ``[ci_low–ci_high]`` band (rate/band omitted on the ``games == 0`` path),
      then — spec 027, only when present — a ``scripted_side`` sub-block (the
      seat's ``side`` + ``wins`` + ``rate``/band), then the bare
      ``draw``/``no_winner`` counts and the immutable ``note`` caveat. A whole
      absent block (pre-013 record) collapses to one ``—`` line.
    - **vote_activity** — AI vote-initiation counts (013 §2.2): a ``by_side``
      sub-block (**both** sides always, the explicit-zero) and a ``by_day``
      sub-block (``day_N: n`` sorted by integer suffix, or a ``(none)`` line when
      empty so "present but no per-day activity" stays distinct from an absent
      block, which collapses to one ``—`` line).
    - **metrics** — one line per :data:`METRIC_ORDER` entry (so order and
      vocabulary match the table's columns). Each **present** metric shows its
      **full-precision** ``rate`` + ``[ci_low–ci_high]`` band (band omitted when
      CI is absent, mirroring the table cell) + ``count/denominator``; an
      **absent** metric shows ``—`` so a never-exercised metric stays visibly
      distinct from a genuine ``0.0``.
